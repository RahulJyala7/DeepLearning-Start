# Notebooks/ Docs for handling text in python.

This folder contains different documents/ python notebooks for handling text in python. 

The Contents of this folder are:

1. [NER Tagger](./NER_tagger) NER tagging of a sequence using stanford NLTK package is shown. 

2. [POS Tagger](./POS_Tagger) Example of POS tagging of a text sequence is shown using NLTK and stanford packages.

3. [Word Embedding](./Word_Embedding.md) which gives an insight on different word embeddings like Glove, Fastext, which are commonly used to extract features from the text. A little about sentence and document level embeddings is also talked about.

4. [Commonly used Regular expressions](./common_regex.md) – A file containing some commonly used Regular Expressions along with the descriptions of the expressions.

5. [Graph Network Analysis](./graph_network_analysis.md) - Some of the important properties of a graph network.

6. [PDF to Doc](./pdf_To_doc.ipynb) – a python notebook to read the pdf documents in python. PDFminer package is used here.

7. [Topic Modelling](./Miscellaneous/topic_modeling.ipynb) – Here topic modelling is done using LDA from sklearn and genism packages.

## Packages used 

pdfminer, sklearn, gensim, nltk
